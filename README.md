# WhizzChat - RealTime Messaging App

## Project Overview

WhizzChat is a real-time messaging platform designed for interactive and seamless communication. Built with robust authentication, the platform ensures secure user interactions. Users can enjoy features like online/offline status visibility of users and real-time messaging using Socket.IO. Styled with React and Tailwind CSS for a modern messaging experience. Its modular codebase ensures scalability and maintainability, making WhizzChat ideal for fast, secure, and interactive messaging needs.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **MERN Stack Architecture:** Developed using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), WhizzChat integrates React for a dynamic, responsive front-end, Express for robust server-side logic, Efficient data flow is maintained between the front-end and back-end, with MongoDB ensuring reliable data storage and streamlined management.

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Enables instant, real-time communication by integrating Socket.IO with Express, allowing seamless, immediate message exchange between users for an engaging chat experience.
  
- **Secure User Authentication:** Implemented a robust user authentication system for secure sign-up, login, and logout processes. Utilized industry-standard password hashing and encryption techniques to ensure sensitive user data is protected.

- **Online/Offline User Status:** Displays active user presence in real time using Socket.IO and React Context API, enhancing user experience by indicating when users are online.

- **Session Management:** Implements secure session management using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookie handling, enhancing user data protection and login persistence.

- **Error Handling and Validation:** Implemented client and server-side data validations, along with efficient error handling to provide feedback on invalid inputs or any errors.

- **Global State Management:** Utilized Zustand for global state management in React, ensuring efficient, centralized control of the application's state, improving performance, and simplifying state-dependent logic.

- **Built frontend with Custom Hooks:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for modern interface design, the frontend incorporates custom hooks for each operation making our codebase look clean, reusable, and maintainable that enhances readability and speeds up future feature integrations.
